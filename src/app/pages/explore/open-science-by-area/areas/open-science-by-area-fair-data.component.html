        <h5>FAIR Data</h5>
        <p>FAIR data principles refer to guidelines that ensure data are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. These principles aim to enhance the utility and availability of data generated by scientific research, promoting more efficient discovery and analysis by both humans and machines. The FAIR principles advocate for robust metadata and data standards, easy discoverability through persistent identifiers, accessible data under well-defined conditions, interoperable formats that allow integration with other datasets, and clear usage licenses to maximize data reuse.</p>

        <h5>Monitoring FAIR data and its challenges</h5>
        <p>Monitoring FAIR data is a complex task due to the evolving nature of definitions surrounding which datasets qualify as FAIR and which do not. As the criteria for assessing data against these principles are still being refined, we currently offer only a limited number of analyses on FAIR data. This limitation reflects the ongoing development in the understanding and implementation of the FAIR principles within the scientific and data management communities. As methodologies mature and definitions become more standardized, we anticipate expanding our analytical offerings to provide more comprehensive insights into FAIR data practices.</p>

            <p>This graph displays the evolving landscape of FAIR data policies among Research Performing Organisations (RPOs) and Research Founding Organisations (RFOs). It shows the percentage of organizations that have implemented policies to support the FAIR data principles as opposed to those without such policies. The colors distinguish between RPOs and RFOs, both with and without FAIR data policies, providing insights into the adoption rates and progress in embedding these principles into their operational frameworks. </p>

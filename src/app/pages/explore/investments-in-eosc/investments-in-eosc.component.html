        <p>The graph illustrates the relationship between total investments in the EOSC and OS and total investments in Open Access (OA) across various countries. Each bubble represents a country, with the size of the bubble indicating the number of OA publication. The x-axis shows total investments in EOSC and OS, while the y-axis shows total investments in OA. The dotted lines represent the average investments across European countries.</p>
        <p>This data helps to visualize how different countries allocate their funds between broader EOSC/OS initiatives and specific Open Access projects, highlighting trends and outliers. Countries positioned above the horizontal dotted line invest more in OA than the average, while those to the right of the vertical dotted line invest more in EOSC and OS than the average.</p>

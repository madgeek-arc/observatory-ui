    <p>Understanding the financial contributions to Open Science and the EOSC is vital for assessing the distribution and impact of investments across Europe. Monitoring these investments allows stakeholders to understand which areas receive the most funding and identify potential disparities in financial commitment across different countries and Open Science areas. This page offers an overview of investments by presenting the allocation of funds across various sectors of Open Science, the specific countries making these investments, and the relations between funding and Open Access publication outputs.</p>

        <p>The graph illustrates the relationship between total investments in the EOSC and OS and total investments in Open Access (OA) across various countries. Each bubble represents a country, with the size of the bubble indicating the number of OA publication. The x-axis shows total investments in EOSC and OS, while the y-axis shows total investments in OA. The dotted lines represent the average investments across European countries.</p>
        <p>This data helps to visualize how different countries allocate their funds between broader EOSC/OS initiatives and specific Open Access projects, highlighting trends and outliers. Countries positioned above the horizontal dotted line invest more in OA than the average, while those to the right of the vertical dotted line invest more in EOSC and OS than the average.</p>
